# Testing Protocol and Timing for Canine Relaxin Pregnancy Test

A properly performed relaxin test provides a rapid, reliable diagnosis of pregnancy in the bitch. This section outlines the recommended timing, sample‑handling requirements, step‑by‑step procedure for common lateral‑flow test kits, and essential quality‑control measures.

## Optimal Timing for Testing

The accuracy of a relaxin test depends critically on testing at the right stage of gestation.

- **Earliest detection window**: Relaxin becomes detectable in maternal blood around **day 20–22** after ovulation or breeding, coinciding with implantation of the fertilized egg.
- **Recommended testing window**: For the highest reliability, test **no earlier than 28 days post‑ovulation** (or 28 days after the last breeding). At this time, relaxin levels are consistently above the detection threshold of commercial assays.
- **Peak levels**: Relaxin concentrations peak between **days 42–56** of pregnancy, making this period ideal for testing if there is uncertainty about breeding dates.
- **Late‑gestation testing**: Relaxin remains elevated until parturition, so testing can be performed at any point after the 28‑day window, including in the last weeks of pregnancy.
- **Post‑partum**: Relaxin can persist for **4–9 weeks** after whelping; a positive result during this period does not indicate a new pregnancy unless re‑breeding has occurred.

> **Clinical pearl**: In cases of unknown breeding date, perform two tests **7–10 days apart**; if both are negative, pregnancy is unlikely. If the first test is negative and the second is positive, pregnancy has progressed past the detection threshold.

## Sample Collection and Handling

Correct sample collection and storage are essential to avoid false‑negative or false‑positive results.

### Acceptable Specimen Types

| Specimen Type       | Tube/Anticoagulant         | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Serum**           | Red‑top or serum‑separator | Preferred for most lateral‑flow kits; allows clear visualization of lines. |
| **Lithium heparin plasma** | Green‑top (Li‑heparin) | Often recommended for certain kits; provides good analyte stability.  |
| **EDTA plasma**     | Lavender‑top (K2/K3 EDTA)  | Acceptable for some assays; check manufacturer’s instructions.        |
| **Whole blood**     | Not recommended            | Most lateral‑flow kits require separated serum or plasma.             |

### Collection Volume

- **Minimum volume**: 0.5 mL of serum or plasma is sufficient for a single test.
- **Ideal volume**: Collect 1–2 mL to allow for repeat testing if needed.

### Sample Processing

1. **Collect blood** using aseptic technique; fill the appropriate tube.
2. **Allow clot formation** (for serum): Let the tube stand upright at room temperature for 15–30 minutes.
3. **Centrifuge** at 1500–2000 g for 10 minutes to separate serum or plasma.
4. **Transfer** the supernatant (serum or plasma) into a clean, labeled plastic tube. Avoid transferring any red blood cells or fibrin strands.
5. **If testing immediately**, keep the sample at room temperature (15–25 °C) and proceed within 4 hours of collection.
6. **If delayed testing**, refrigerate the sample (2–8 °C) for up to 48 hours, or freeze at ≤‑20 °C for longer storage. Thaw frozen samples completely and mix gently before use.

## Step‑by‑Step Procedure (Lateral‑Flow Test Kits)

The following steps are typical for commercial lateral‑flow relaxin tests (e.g., Witness™ Relaxin, FASTest® Relaxin, BellyLabs). **Always refer to the specific manufacturer’s instructions** for your kit.

### Materials Needed

- Test cassette (remove from foil pouch just before use)
- Disposable plastic pipette(s)
- Buffer diluent (provided in the kit)
- Timer
- Flat, clean, dry work surface

### Procedure

1. **Prepare the sample**: Ensure serum or plasma is at room temperature (15–25 °C). Mix gently by inverting the tube several times.
2. **Open the test cassette**: Tear the foil pouch and place the cassette on a flat, non‑absorbent surface.
3. **Apply the sample**: Using a clean pipette, transfer **2 drops (approx. 80–100 µL)** of serum or heparin plasma into the sample well (usually marked “A” or “S”).
4. **Add buffer diluent**: Hold the buffer bottle vertically and add **2 drops (approx. 80–100 µL)** of buffer diluent into the same well.
5. **Observe flow**: Within 1 minute, a lateral flow should become visible across the test window. If no migration is seen, add **1 additional drop of buffer diluent** to initiate flow.
6. **Start the timer**: Note the time after adding the buffer.
7. **Read the result** between **10 and 30 minutes** after adding the buffer. Do not interpret results before 10 minutes or after 30 minutes.

## Interpretation of Test Lines

| Result               | Control Line (C) | Test Line (B) | Interpretation                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Positive**         | Visible          | Visible       | Relaxin is present at a concentration above the test’s cutoff. Pregnancy is confirmed. |
| **Negative**         | Visible          | Absent        | Relaxin is below the detection limit. Pregnancy is unlikely, but a very early pregnancy cannot be excluded. |
| **Invalid**          | Absent           | Any appearance | Test did not run correctly; repeat with a new cassette and fresh sample.      |
| **Weak positive**    | Visible          | Faint, pink‑purple | Usually indicates low relaxin concentration; consider pregnancy as confirmed, but if timing is uncertain, retest in 7 days. |

**Important**: A positive result is defined by the presence of **both** the control line and the test line, regardless of the intensity of the test line. A negative result requires a visible control line with **no** test line. Any result without a control line is invalid.

## Quality Control and Troubleshooting

### Pre‑Test Checks

- Verify the expiration date on the test kit.
- Ensure the foil pouch is intact and the desiccant is still dry.
- Bring all reagents and the sample to room temperature before starting.

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem                                      | Possible Cause                          | Recommended Action                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No lateral flow after adding buffer          | Insufficient buffer or clogged membrane | Add one extra drop of buffer diluent. If still no flow, repeat with a new cassette. |
| Control line not appearing                   | Improper storage, expired kit, or insufficient sample volume | Repeat with a fresh cassette and a new sample aliquot. Ensure correct sample volume and use only recommended specimen types. |
| Faint or shadow‑like test line              | Non‑specific binding or old sample     | Interpret as negative if the line is not clearly pink‑purple. Repeat with a fresh sample if uncertain. |
| Sample appears hemolyzed or lipemic          | Interference with test chemistry       | Collect a new sample; avoid hemolysis during collection. If lipemia is present, note that it may affect test performance. |
| Test result read outside the 10‑30‑minute window | Delayed reading                         | Discard the result; repeat the test and read within the specified time interval.   |

### Recording and Reporting

- Document the date of sampling, the bitch’s identification, breeding dates (if known), and the exact time the test was run.
- Note the appearance of both control and test lines, as well as any atypical observations (e.g., faint lines, unusual background color).
- Report the result as “Positive,” “Negative,” or “Invalid” along with a brief interpretation (e.g., “Positive result consistent with pregnancy after 28 days post‑breeding”).
