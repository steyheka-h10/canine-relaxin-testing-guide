# Interpreting Relaxin Test Results in Canine Pregnancy

Correct interpretation of relaxin test results is crucial for accurate pregnancy diagnosis. This section explains how to read the test lines, what each result means, the test’s sensitivity and specificity, and how to handle ambiguous or unexpected outcomes.

## Understanding the Test Lines

All lateral‑flow relaxin test cassettes have two critical lines:

1. **Control line (C)** – A line that must appear in every valid test, confirming that the test cassette and buffer worked correctly.
2. **Test line (T)** – A line that appears only when relaxin is present in the sample above the assay’s detection threshold.

The result is read between **10 and 30 minutes** after adding the buffer diluent. Reading outside this window may lead to erroneous interpretation.

## Result Categories

### Positive Result

- **Appearance**: Both the control line **and** the test line are visible, regardless of the intensity of the test line.
- **Interpretation**: Relaxin is present at a concentration sufficient to be detected. This confirms **pregnancy** (i.e., a functional placenta exists).
- **Clinical implications**:
    - Pregnancy is confirmed; the bitch should be managed accordingly (nutrition, exercise restriction, preparation for whelping).
    - A positive result can be obtained as early as **day 20–22** after ovulation, but is most reliable after **day 28**.
    - A positive result remains positive throughout gestation and for **4–9 weeks after whelping**; a positive test during this postpartum period does **not** indicate a new pregnancy unless re‑breeding has occurred.

### Negative Result

- **Appearance**: The control line is visible, but **no test line** is present.
- **Interpretation**: Relaxin is below the detection limit of the assay.
- **Clinical implications**:
    - Pregnancy is **unlikely** if the test is performed after the recommended window (≥28 days post‑ovulation).
    - A negative result **does not completely rule out pregnancy** if:
        - The test was performed **too early** (before day 28). In this case, repeat the test 7–10 days later.
        - The sample was mishandled (e.g., improperly stored, hemolyzed, lipemic) causing analyte degradation.
        - The bitch experienced **early embryonic loss** after implantation but before relaxin became detectable.
    - If the breeding date is uncertain and the first test is negative, a second test **7–10 days later** is recommended to exclude pregnancy.

### Weak Positive Result

- **Appearance**: The control line is clearly visible, and a **faint, pink‑purple test line** is present.
- **Interpretation**: Relaxin is present but at a concentration near the lower detection limit of the assay.
- **Clinical implications**:
    - **Treat as a positive result** – any visible test line, no matter how faint, indicates pregnancy.
    - A weak positive is commonly seen:
        - In **very early pregnancy** (days 20–27) when relaxin concentrations are just rising.
        - In bitches with a **small litter size** (lower total placental mass).
        - If the sample was **partially hemolyzed** or **lipemic**, which can interfere with line intensity.
    - **Recommendation**: Document the result as “positive” and, if timing is uncertain, repeat the test in 7 days to see if the line becomes stronger as relaxin levels rise.

### Invalid Result

- **Appearance**: The control line is **absent**, regardless of whether a test line appears.
- **Interpretation**: The test did not run correctly; the result cannot be trusted.
- **Causes**:
    - Insufficient sample volume.
    - Use of an inappropriate specimen type (e.g., whole blood, citrate plasma).
    - Expired or improperly stored test cassette.
    - Technical error (e.g., adding buffer before sample, using a damaged cassette).
- **Action**: Discard the cassette and repeat the test with a **fresh cassette and a new aliquot of sample**.

## Sensitivity and Specificity of Relaxin Tests

Understanding the performance characteristics of the assay helps you weigh the reliability of a result.

- **Sensitivity**: The probability that the test will be positive when the bitch is truly pregnant.
    - **Early gestation (21–27 days)**: Sensitivity is lower (≈60–80%) because relaxin levels may still be below the detection threshold.
    - **After day 28**: Sensitivity approaches **100%**; virtually all pregnant bitches will test positive.
- **Specificity**: The probability that the test will be negative when the bitch is truly **not** pregnant.
    - Relaxin tests are **highly specific** (≈95–100%) because relaxin is produced almost exclusively by the placenta during pregnancy.
    - **False positives** are rare but can occur in the presence of:
        - **Ovarian cysts** (particularly large cysts that may produce relaxin‑like substances).
        - **Certain ovarian tumors** (e.g., granulosa‑cell tumors).
        - **Cross‑reactivity** with other hormones (uncommon with modern monoclonal‑antibody tests).
- **Accuracy**: When performed after the recommended window (≥28 days), commercial relaxin tests have an overall accuracy of **96–98%**.

## Clinical Scenarios and How to Interpret Them

### Scenario 1: Known breeding date, test performed at day 25

- **Result**: Negative.
- **Interpretation**: Pregnancy cannot be excluded; repeat testing at day 32–35. A negative result at day 25 is common because relaxin may not yet have reached detectable levels.

### Scenario 2: Unknown breeding date, test performed today

- **Result**: Positive.
- **Interpretation**: Pregnancy is confirmed. If the bitch shows no abdominal enlargement or mammary development, she is likely in the first half of gestation. Ultrasound can be used to estimate fetal age.

### Scenario 3: Bitch whelped 5 weeks ago, no re‑breeding

- **Result**: Positive.
- **Interpretation**: This is normal; relaxin can persist for several weeks after parturition. Do not misinterpret as a new pregnancy.

### Scenario 4: Bitch with abdominal distension and mammary development, test negative at day 35

- **Interpretation**: Consider **pseudopregnancy** (false pregnancy), which does not produce relaxin. Alternatively, sample mishandling or a test error could have occurred. Repeat the test with a fresh sample; if still negative, perform ultrasound to rule out pregnancy.

### Scenario 5: Weak positive at day 30, but the owner reports no observed mating

- **Interpretation**: Treat as a true positive; an unobserved mating may have occurred. Advise the owner to prepare for whelping and consider ultrasound to confirm pregnancy and estimate litter size.

## Common Owner Questions (Q&A)

**Q: The test line is very faint – does that mean my dog is only a little pregnant?**  
**A:** No. Any visible test line, even faint, indicates pregnancy. The intensity of the line does not correlate with litter size or stage of gestation.

**Q: Can a relaxin test be wrong?**  
**A:** Yes, but errors are uncommon when the test is performed correctly after the recommended window. False negatives can occur if testing is done too early; false positives are rare but possible with ovarian pathology.

**Q: How soon after breeding can the test detect pregnancy?**  
**A:** The earliest detection is around day 20–22, but for reliable results wait until at least day 28 after ovulation (or after the last breeding).

**Q: My dog had a positive test but later miscarried. Why?**  
**A:** A positive test confirms that a placenta was present at the time of testing. Early embryonic loss can occur after the test, leading to miscarriage. The test does not predict pregnancy outcome.

**Q: Can a spayed dog have a positive relaxin test?**  
**A:** No. Without ovaries and uterus, there is no source of relaxin. A positive result in a spayed dog would be extremely unusual and should prompt investigation for ovarian remnant syndrome or cross‑reacting substances.

## Documentation and Reporting

Always record the following information when interpreting a relaxin test:

- Date of sample collection.
- Bitch identification (name, microchip, etc.).
- Known or estimated breeding/ovulation dates.
- Time the test was run and time the result was read.
- Appearance of control and test lines (e.g., “control line strong, test line faint but clearly visible”).
- Final interpretation (Positive, Negative, Invalid).
- Any recommendations for follow‑up (e.g., repeat testing, ultrasound).

*Interpretation should always be combined with the clinical picture. When in doubt, repeat the test or use complementary methods such as ultrasonography for definitive diagnosis.*
