# Physiology of Relaxin in Canine Pregnancy

Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone belonging to the insulin family and is the only pregnancy-specific hormone identified in dogs. Understanding its physiology is essential for proper interpretation of relaxin-based pregnancy tests and for appreciating its role in maintaining gestation.

## What is Relaxin?

- **Chemical nature**: Relaxin is a peptide hormone composed of two chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds, structurally similar to insulin and insulin-like growth factors.
- **Species specificity**: In dogs, relaxin is a reliable marker of pregnancy because it is produced exclusively during gestation, unlike in some other species where low levels may be present in non-pregnant states.

## Production Sites

The primary source of circulating relaxin in pregnant dogs is the **placenta**, specifically the cytotrophoblast cells. However, other tissues also contribute:

1. **Placenta** – The dominant source; placental tissue contains the highest concentrations of relaxin immunoreactivity.
2. **Corpus luteum** – The ovarian corpus luteum expresses relaxin mRNA and protein, especially after implantation, but ovariectomy during pregnancy does not significantly affect serum relaxin levels, indicating that the luteal contribution is minor compared to the placenta.
3. **Uterus** – Endometrial and myometrial cells synthesize relaxin, likely serving local paracrine functions.
4. **Adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary)** – Relaxin is co‑localized with prolactin in lactotrophs, suggesting a neuroendocrine role in regulating prolactin secretion, which in turn supports luteal function.

## Timing of Appearance and Concentration Profile

- **First detection**: Relaxin becomes detectable in maternal blood around **days 20–25** after mating (approximately 4 weeks of pregnancy).
- **Peak levels**: Concentrations rise to a maximum of **4–6 ng/mL** about 2–3 weeks before parturition.
- **Pre‑partum decline**: Levels drop slightly just before whelping but remain elevated (0.5–2.0 ng/mL) for **4–9 weeks after birth**, reflecting persistent placental remnants or uterine production.
- **Disappearance**: Relaxin is cleared from the circulation within a few days after placental expulsion, making it a specific indicator of active pregnancy.

## Physiological Roles

Although the exact functions of relaxin in dogs are still being elucidated, research in other mammals and emerging canine studies suggest the following roles:

1. **Connective‑tissue remodeling** – Relaxin softens the pubic ligament, cervix, and pelvic connective tissue, preparing the birth canal for parturition.
2. **Uterine quiescence** – May act synergistically with progesterone to inhibit myometrial contractions, helping to maintain pregnancy.
3. **Luteotropic support** – Local relaxin in the corpus luteum may enhance progesterone synthesis and promote luteal vascularization via stimulation of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
4. **Prolactin regulation** – Relaxin in the anterior pituitary may stimulate prolactin release, which is essential for luteal maintenance during the second half of gestation.
5. **Immunomodulation** – Presence of relaxin receptors on luteal macrophages suggests a role in modulating local immune responses.

## Relationship with Other Pregnancy Hormones

- **Progesterone**: Relaxin and progesterone are both crucial for pregnancy maintenance. Relaxin may support luteal progesterone production, and progesterone receptor antagonists (e.g., aglepristone) can suppress luteal relaxin expression, indicating a feedback loop.
- **Prolactin**: Relaxin‑induced prolactin secretion from the pituitary provides luteotropic support; dopamine agonists that suppress prolactin lead to luteolysis and abortion.
- **Estrogens**: Unlike many other domestic animals, dogs do not produce conjugated estrogens during pregnancy. Estrogen levels remain low throughout gestation and drop to basal levels only when progesterone declines just before parturition.
- **Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)**: The placenta is a major source of pre‑parturient PGF2α, which, together with the precipitous fall in progesterone, triggers labor. Relaxin does not directly regulate PGF2α but may influence the timing of its release.

## Key Takeaways for the Veterinary Technician

1. **Relaxin is pregnancy‑specific** – A positive relaxin test confirms the presence of a functional placenta (i.e., ongoing pregnancy).
2. **Timing matters** – Testing before day 20–25 post‑mating may yield false‑negative results because relaxin is not yet detectable.
3. **Persistent postpartum levels** – Detectable relaxin for several weeks after whelping is normal and does not indicate retained placenta unless clinical signs are present.
4. **Multiple tissue sources** – Although the placenta is the main source, contributions from the corpus luteum and uterus explain why relaxin can remain measurable after placental delivery.
